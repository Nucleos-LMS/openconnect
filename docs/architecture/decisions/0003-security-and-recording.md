# 3. Security and Recording Requirements

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Correctional facilities have strict requirements around video calls:
- Legal calls must be protected and not recorded
- Non-protected calls may be recorded and monitored
- AI monitoring may be used for security
- All communications must be secure and auditable

## Decision
We will implement a comprehensive security model that:

1. Call Protection
   - Legal calls marked as protected
   - Protected calls cannot be recorded
   - End-to-end encryption for all calls
   - Role-based access control

2. Recording System
   - Recording only allowed for non-protected calls
   - AI monitoring capabilities
   - Secure storage with retention policies
   - Audit logging of all access

3. Security Features
   - Participant verification
   - Session monitoring
   - Access controls
   - Encryption throughout

## Consequences
### Positive
- Clear separation of protected/non-protected calls
- Comprehensive security model
- Flexible recording capabilities
- AI monitoring integration
- Audit compliance

### Negative
- Additional complexity in provider implementations
- Need for secure storage solutions
- AI monitoring infrastructure requirements
- More complex testing requirements

## Implementation
```typescript
interface SecuritySettings {
  isProtectedCall: boolean;
  encryptionEnabled: boolean;
  allowRecording: boolean;
  allowAIMonitoring: boolean;
  requiredParticipantRoles?: string[];
}

interface RecordingInfo {
  id: string;
  startTime: Date;
  status: 'active' | 'paused' | 'stopped';
  duration: number;
  aiMonitoringEnabled: boolean;
  retentionPeriod: number;
}
```
