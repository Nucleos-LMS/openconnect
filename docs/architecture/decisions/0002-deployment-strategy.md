# 2. Deployment Strategy

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Correctional facilities need to:
- Self-host the video platform
- Manage their own data
- Control security settings
- Deploy with minimal IT overhead
- Update the system easily

## Decision
We will provide multiple deployment options:
1. Docker Compose for self-hosting
   - Frontend container
   - Backend container
   - Simple environment configuration

2. Cloud Marketplace Templates
   - AWS CloudFormation
   - Azure ARM Templates
   - GCP Deployment Manager

3. Documentation
   - Step-by-step deployment guides
   - Security best practices
   - Troubleshooting guides

## Consequences
### Positive
- Easy self-hosting
- Multiple deployment options
- Simple configuration
- Clear upgrade path
- Good security practices

### Negative
- Need to maintain multiple deployment templates
- More complex testing requirements
- Additional documentation burden
- Version synchronization challenges

## Implementation
```yaml
# Example docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    environment:
      - VITE_API_URL=http://backend:8000
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"

  backend:
    build: ./backend
    environment:
      - VIDEO_PROVIDER=twilio
      - VIDEO_API_KEY=${VIDEO_API_KEY}
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
```
