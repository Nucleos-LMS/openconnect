# 1. Video Provider Abstraction Layer

## Status
Proposed

## Context
We need to build a video communication platform for correctional facilities that:
- Supports multiple video providers (Twilio, Google Meet, Daily.co)
- Can be self-hosted by facilities
- Manages API keys securely
- Works within facility technical constraints
- Enables easy provider switching

## Decision
We will create a provider abstraction layer that:
1. Defines a common interface for all video providers
2. Uses a factory pattern for provider instantiation
3. Manages configuration via environment variables
4. Provides a consistent API across providers

## Consequences
### Positive
- Facilities can switch providers without code changes
- Simplified provider integration
- Consistent API across providers
- Easy testing with mock providers
- Clear separation of concerns

### Negative
- Additional abstraction layer complexity
- Need to maintain provider-specific implementations
- May not expose all provider-specific features
- Potential performance overhead

## Implementation
```typescript
interface VideoProvider {
  initialize(config: ProviderConfig): Promise<void>;
  createRoom(options: RoomOptions): Promise<Room>;
  joinRoom(roomId: string, participant: Participant): Promise<void>;
  leaveRoom(roomId: string, participantId: string): Promise<void>;
}
```
