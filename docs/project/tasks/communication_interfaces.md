# Communication Interfaces Implementation Plan

## Current Focus: Video Call Room Implementation

### Phase 1: Core Video Call Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up WebRTC infrastructure
  - [ ] Configure STUN/TURN servers
  - [ ] Implement signaling server
  - [ ] Set up connection handling
  - [ ] Implement bandwidth adaptation

- [ ] Basic UI Components
  - [ ] Video display container
  - [ ] Audio/video controls
  - [ ] Connection status indicator
  - [ ] Call timer
  - [ ] Basic error handling

### Phase 2: Security Layer
- [ ] Implement end-to-end encryption
- [ ] Set up authentication flow
- [ ] Add IP/location verification
- [ ] Implement recording controls
- [ ] Add security indicators

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features
- [ ] Waiting room implementation
- [ ] Quality monitoring and adaptation
- [ ] Screen sharing (for legal/education)
- [ ] Chat functionality
- [ ] Document sharing (for legal)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Create base VideoRoom component
2. Implement WebRTC connection handling
3. Design and implement basic UI controls
4. Set up error handling and reconnection
5. Add basic security measures

### Technical Considerations
- WebRTC implementation using `LiveKit` (self-hosted SFU)
- State management with Redux/Context
- UI components using Chakra UI
- Error boundary implementation
- Performance monitoring setup

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for UI components
- Integration tests for WebRTC
- End-to-end testing plan
- Security testing procedures
- Performance benchmarking

## Dependencies
- WebRTC library (simple-peer)
- STUN/TURN server setup
- Authentication service
- Monitoring service
- Recording service (when needed)

## Questions to Resolve
- [ ] TURN server hosting solution
- [ ] Recording storage requirements
- [ ] Bandwidth requirements per facility
- [ ] Facility-specific security requirements
- [ ] Compliance requirements by jurisdiction

## Notes
- Focus on simplicity and reliability
- Prioritize security and privacy
- Consider varying bandwidth conditions
- Plan for scalability
- Document all security measures
