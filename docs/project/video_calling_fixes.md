# Video Calling Implementation Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve the client/server component boundary issues in the video calling functionality of the OpenConnect platform.

## Problem Statement
The video calling functionality was broken due to Next.js client/server component boundary issues. Specifically, the error "Event handlers cannot be passed to Client Component props" was occurring when attempting to start a new call.

## Root Causes
1. **Component Boundary Violations**: The original implementation was passing event handlers from server components to client components, which is not allowed in Next.js.
2. **Missing Client Directives**: The pages that needed to handle user interactions were not marked with the 'use client' directive.
3. **Environment Configuration**: The Twilio provider was not properly configured to use environment variables.

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Client-Side Conversion of Call Pages
- Converted `/app/calls/new/page.tsx` to a client component with the 'use client' directive
- Implemented proper error handling and loading states
- Added toast notifications for user feedback

### 2. Created VideoRoomWrapper Component
- Created a new client-side wrapper component for the VideoRoom
- Properly handles session data and authentication
- Manages the client-side state and user interactions

### 3. Updated CallPage Component
- Simplified the CallPage component to use the VideoRoomWrapper
- Removed redundant code and improved maintainability

### 4. Enhanced Twilio Provider Configuration
- Updated the TwilioProvider to use environment variables
- Added fallback logic for API key and secret
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing configuration

## Testing Results
- Successfully tested with family member user type
- Waiting room loads correctly without errors
- Join Call button works as expected
- No client/server component boundary errors occur

## Environment Configuration
The following environment variables are required for the video calling functionality:
```
# NextAuth Configuration
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=openconnect-development-secret-key

# Database Configuration
POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/openconnect
POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/openconnect

# Twilio Configuration
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token
TWILIO_API_KEY_SID=your_api_key_sid
TWILIO_API_KEY_SECRET=your_api_key_secret
```

## Next Steps
1. Complete the participant selection interface
2. Implement call recording functionality
3. Add proper error handling for network issues
4. Enhance the UI for different device sizes
5. Add call quality monitoring and adaptation
