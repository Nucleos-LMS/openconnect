# Family Member Registration Flow

## Registration Process Overview
- Registration flow begins with user type selection
- Family Member option is clearly presented with appropriate icon and description
- Email verification is the first step after user type selection

## Registration Steps
1. **User Type Selection**
   - Options: Family Member, Legal Representative, Educator
   - Clear descriptions for each user type
   - Family Member option: "Connect with your incarcerated loved ones"

2. **Email Verification**
   - Email input with validation
   - "Continue" button to proceed
   - Message indicating verification link will be sent
   - **Issue**: Backend error when clicking Continue - "Unexpected token '<', '<!DOCTYPE '... is not valid JSON"
   - **Issue**: Form submission fails with JSON parsing error

3. **Expected Next Steps (Not Functional)**
   - Personal Information
   - Identity Verification
   - Relationship Information
   - Contact Approval
   - Completion

## Implementation Status
- User interface for initial steps is implemented
- Backend integration is incomplete
- Form validation works for email field
- API endpoint for email verification appears to be returning HTML instead of JSON
- Navigation between steps is not functional

## Technical Analysis
Based on the code review:
- Registration flow is defined in `src/components/features/registration/types.ts`
- Steps include: 'user_type', 'email_verification', 'personal_info', 'identity_verification', 'relationship_info', 'contact_approval', 'complete'
- Components exist for each step but backend integration is incomplete
- API endpoint for email verification needs to be fixed to return proper JSON

## Security Considerations
- Email verification is the first security step
- Identity verification is planned but not implemented
- Facility approval process is referenced but not functional

## Conclusion
The registration flow for Family Members has a complete UI implementation but lacks proper backend integration. The email verification step fails with a JSON parsing error, indicating that the API endpoint is returning HTML instead of the expected JSON response.
