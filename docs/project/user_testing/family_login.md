# Family Member Login Experience

## Login Process
- Successfully logged in using test credentials: `family@test.facility.com` / `password`
- Login form is simple and functional with email and password fields
- Login page displays available test users for development purposes
- Authentication flow works correctly with proper session management
- Success notifications appear after login

## Dashboard Overview
- User is greeted with "Welcome, Test User" and role badge "FAMILY"
- Dashboard shows role-specific UI for family members
- Quick Actions section includes:
  - Start New Call button
  - View My Calls button
- Profile view button is available in the top right
- Session authentication notification confirms successful login

## Issues/Limitations
- Generic "Test User" name instead of personalized name
- Limited role-specific content on the dashboard
- No family resources section visible despite being mentioned in the code
- Debug button visible in production UI (should be removed for production)
- Multiple success notifications appear (possible UI bug)

## Authentication Implementation
- NextAuth.js is properly configured with session management
