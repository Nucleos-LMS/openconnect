# Incarcerated User Dashboard Functionality

## Dashboard Overview
- Simple, clean interface with role-specific UI for incarcerated individuals
- User is identified as "Test User" with "RESIDENT" role badge
- Session data shows user role as "resident" with facility_id "123"

## Available Features
- **Quick Actions Section**:
  - "Start New Call" button (primary action)
  - "View My Calls" button (secondary action)
- **Profile Management**:
  - "View Profile" button in top right corner
- **Session Management**:
  - Session debugger showing authentication status
  - Session data with user details and expiration

## Missing Features
- No educational programs section visible despite being referenced in the code
- No contact management functionality visible
- No schedule visits functionality visible
- Limited personalization (generic "Test User" name)

## Navigation Testing
- Dashboard loads correctly after login
- Session persistence works correctly
- Debug panel shows correct user information

## UI/UX Observations
- Clean, minimal interface focused on core communication functionality
- Limited role-specific content compared to what's defined in the Dashboard.tsx component
- Debug panel visible in production UI (should be removed for production)
- No loading states or error handling visible in the UI

## Technical Implementation
- NextAuth.js session contains user role and facility ID
- Session expiration set to April 10, 2025
- Role-based access control implemented correctly
- Dashboard component conditionally renders UI based on user role
