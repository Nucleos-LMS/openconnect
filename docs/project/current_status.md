# OpenConnect Project Status

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the OpenConnect project, including implemented features, user types, and next steps for development.

## Project Description
OpenConnect is a Next.js application designed to connect incarcerated individuals with their families, legal representatives, and educators through secure video calling and communication tools.

## Current Implementation Status

### User Types
The system currently supports the following user types:
1. **Incarcerated Individuals** (Residents)
   - Can make calls to approved contacts
   - Subject to facility calling policies
   - Can view call history

2. **Family Members**
   - Must be approved by facility
   - Can receive and schedule calls
   - Can manage contact information

3. **Staff**
   - Can monitor calls
   - Can manage resident permissions
   - Can review recordings

4. **Legal Representatives**
   - Enhanced privacy protections
   - Exempt from standard monitoring
   - Can schedule priority calls

5. **Educators**
   - Can facilitate educational programs
   - Can schedule group sessions
   - Can share educational resources

### Implemented Features

#### Authentication System
- NextAuth.js implementation
- User login and session management
- Role-based access control
- Session persistence and refresh mechanisms

#### User Registration
- Multi-step registration flow
- User type selection
- Email verification
- Identity verification
- Relationship/connection management

#### Dashboard
- User-specific dashboard based on role
- Call history and scheduling
- Contact management
- Settings and profile management

#### Video Calling
- Twilio integration for video calls
- Waiting room functionality
- Call scheduling
- Recording capabilities (except for legal calls)
- Quality adaptation based on network conditions

#### Database Integration
- Neon PostgreSQL database
- Vercel integration for deployment
- Database schema for users, facilities, calls, and participants

### Technical Infrastructure
- Next.js frontend
- API routes for backend functionality
- Chakra UI for component styling
- Twilio for video communication
- Vercel for deployment
- Neon for database

## Development Status
The project is currently in active development with the following components in various stages of completion:

1. **Authentication** - Functional but requires environment configuration
2. **User Registration** - UI implemented, backend integration in progress
3. **Dashboard** - Basic implementation complete, needs refinement
4. **Video Calling** - Core functionality implemented, needs testing
5. **Database** - Schema defined, integration with frontend in progress

## Next Steps

### Short-term Priorities
1. Complete environment configuration for local development
2. Implement proper database seeding for testing
3. Finalize user registration flow with backend integration
4. Enhance dashboard with role-specific features
5. Complete video calling integration with proper security measures

### Medium-term Goals
1. Implement comprehensive monitoring system for calls
2. Develop facility management interface
3. Add scheduling and calendar integration
4. Enhance security features and compliance measures
5. Implement analytics and reporting

### Long-term Vision
1. Mobile application development
2. Integration with correctional facility management systems
3. Advanced AI monitoring for security
4. Expanded educational resources
5. Support for group sessions and classes

## Technical Debt and Issues
1. Authentication environment configuration needs standardization
2. Type definitions require cleanup and standardization
3. Test coverage needs improvement
4. Documentation requires expansion
5. Error handling needs enhancement

## Conclusion
The OpenConnect project has established a solid foundation with core features implemented. The next phase of development should focus on completing the integration between frontend components and backend services, enhancing the user experience, and ensuring security and compliance measures are properly implemented.
